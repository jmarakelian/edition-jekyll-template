This site is for documenting the sprint and bug tickets that I interact with while working on FACTRAX projects.

Ordering will be based on newest to oldest and segmented into a sprint-by-sprint basis. So if something is under R6S8, it will be under the R6S8 header.

The purpose of this is to provide a searchable database for things that I might want to reference in the future. I will also be able to provide links on things as I work on them as a reference point in order to structure and provide some more organization for my work.
